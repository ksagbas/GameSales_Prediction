# GameSales-Prediction

## Project Overview  
This project aims to predict video game sales based on various features such as game genre, pricing, user reviews, and release dates. By analyzing historical sales data, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that impact game performance. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that helps businesses make data-driven decisions on pricing, marketing, and stock management.

## Objectives  
1. **Analyze Game Sales Factors**  
   Investigate how price, game genre, user ratings, and release timing influence game sales.  
2. **Build a Sales Prediction Model**  
   Develop a machine learning model to forecast future game sales.  
3. **Identify Market Trends**  
   Use historical data to detect emerging trends in the gaming industry.  
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**  
   Help businesses optimize pricing and inventory management strategies based on data insights.

## Motivation  
Understanding game sales dynamics is essential for both developers and publishers. This project provides insights into:  
- **Business Strategy Optimization** → Companies can optimize stock management and marketing based on sales trends.  
- **Consumer Behavior Analysis** → Identifying what factors contribute to game popularity and sales growth.  
- **Data Science Application** → Implementing real-world data science techniques in a meaningful and impactful project.

## Dataset  
The dataset for this project consists of:  
- **Game Title** → Name of the video game.  
- **Release Date** → The official launch date of the game.  
- **Genre** → The category of the game (e.g., RPG, FPS, Strategy).  
- **Platform** → The gaming system it was released on (e.g., PC, PlayStation, Xbox).  
- **User Ratings** → Aggregated scores from gaming platforms.  
- **Price** → The price at which the game was sold at launch.  
- **Sales Data** → Units sold (if available) or player count as a proxy for popularity.  
- **Marketing Factors** → Promotional campaigns, pre-orders, and review sentiment.  

The dataset will be collected from platforms like Steam, Metacritic, and other publicly available gaming sales data sources.

## Tools and Technologies  
We will use the following tools for data collection, analysis, and prediction:  
- **Python** → Primary programming language for data analysis.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** → Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization for exploratory analysis.  
- **Scikit-Learn** → Machine learning models for sales prediction.  
- **BeautifulSoup & API Integration** → Web scraping and API data collection.

## Analysis Plan  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather game sales data from online sources (Steam, Metacritic, etc.).  
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and inconsistencies.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Create visualizations to understand trends and relationships between variables.  
   - Analyze correlations between features such as price, ratings, and sales.  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Generate new features such as time-based trends and sentiment scores from reviews.  
4. **Model Development**  
   - Train machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict game sales.  
   - Evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.  
5. **Prediction & Insights**  
   - Use the trained model to forecast sales of upcoming games.  
   - Provide actionable insights for pricing and marketing strategies.

## Example Analysis  
To illustrate, we will analyze how user ratings influence game sales by plotting a scatter plot with user ratings on the x-axis and sales (or player count) on the y-axis. A strong positive correlation would indicate that higher-rated games tend to sell more copies.  

We will also analyze seasonal trends in game sales, identifying whether certain months yield higher sales figures and whether price drops significantly impact revenue generation.

## Expected Outcomes  
By the end of this project, we aim to answer the following questions:  
- Which factors have the strongest impact on video game sales?  
- Can we accurately predict game sales based on historical data?  
- How can publishers optimize pricing and marketing strategies using data insights?  
- What are the best release windows for maximizing game sales?  

This project provides valuable business insights into the gaming industry.
